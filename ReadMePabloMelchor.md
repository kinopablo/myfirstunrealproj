This repository was my testing ground for assests and fnctionality before I would implement them into our group repo.
This repository is my first programing project (excluding a pong tutorial I made in unity and some flash I did 10years ago).
This repository also was a testing ground when it comes to using github. I had many problems and learned the hard way. 
I lost about 50 comits, destroyed my .git folder, lost maps and assets. It has been paynfull but the learning curve was fantastic.

About our project: The Devil Is In The Details

The devil is in the details is a first person horror-puzzle game inspired by some childhood nightmares of the team that developed it. In the game, we play as a child trapped in a nightmarish maze that has to solve the challenges in it to collect and bring three gnome statues to their corresponding place in order to enter the warm and safe manor in the middle of the maze. However, this task will be harder than it seems, as we will be constantly chased by the Bill the Tar Man, a man eater ghoul that lives in the maze and doesn’t like intruders. The Maze is full of secrets, and in order to distinguish what’s real from what’s not, you will have to use the magic glasses. With them, you will be able to solve all the riddles in the maze and wake up before Bill catches you.

process:
Retro-planning, phases and spread of the work.
We all agreed to work together quite early on in the year. We are a group of quite diverse backgrounds and personalities. We are all very passionate individuals in life and about video games. We were always aware of the challenge of managing our team effort and did everything we could to ensure a smooth process. Not only we are 6 in our group but we all have very different ways of working and we all want to be “game designer”. On one side, we all have complementary skills and experiences but on the other side, we all have our ways of communicating and it was clear that the challenge was going to be more on the human side. My fear was that we would be too many cooks on the same dish. We were also aware that everyone needed to do some programing and some modeling (to get the grades) so we had to come up with an organisation that would spread all the tasks evenly. 
I took the role to facilitate that group aspect (with Luis) by organising regular and slightly formal meetings with a clear agendas, questions to answer, topics to discuss and decision to be made. We had great brainstorming sessions where we were careful that everyone express themselves, their ideas and opinions and that everyone was happy with the directions we were taking. We have also been taking minutes of our meetings and always left with a clearer idea of the game and new tasks for everyone as well as new deadlines. 
We also immediately set up good communications links between us making the most out of facebook messenger (slack wouldn’t work on everyone’s computer), googleDoc and of course github. 
I can say that we had a truly democratic and non-hierarchical process, probably very different from how it happens in the industry but ensuring a smooth running of operations for us by empowering everyone and assuring mutual ownership of the project. We all worked very hard on this game.

Finding the Concept and spreading the tasks:
For the first few meetings, we booked a quiet space with a screen in the library. We all brought ideas for games we would like to create, shared references and quickly came up with the idea that it would be a sort of escape the room but inverted. 
A game where you are outside chased and need to get in to be safe. 
Straight after  we started splitting the areas of focus between us, 
Thomas on programing for the gameplay mechanic, 
Luis and myself focusing on concept, puzzle programing and designing 
Toby, Gabriella and Angela feeding and bouncing ideas and creating the final assets and decoration. 
We relatively quickly came up with our final idea, somewhere between an escape the room and an exploration game.
We all went on to do different tutorials relating to the tasks we took on and tested them in a separate project files to not overload the github of our final project (especially with the unreal starter pack being so heavy)
From there we made sure that all the aspects and elements of the game were going to be covered and the tasks spread between us with a first “to do list” (here in google doc).

My part:
-design of a garden gnome 
-programing of some of the character’s interactions
-the conception and creation of a puzzle
-the background narrative
-Design of 2d start and end menus
-modular asset for wall and indoor space
-assets for the magical realm (only visible when wearing magic spectacles)
-The 2d masks applied when wearing spectacles or when hit by the “monster”
-sound effects and music
-post processing effects and rendering looks (normal and magic)
-design of additional props and plants.

For the purpose of this
